Checkmail.module check's your POP3 Mailaccount and outputs the number of mails in your 
INBOX, and the total size of the mails in your mailbox.

WORKS ONLY WITH A POP3 MAIL ACCOUNT!!!



Install
-------

1. Copy checkmail.module to your \modules\ directory.
2. Enable the module in 'Admin' | 'Site Settings' | 'modules'.
3. Configure it under 'Admin' | 'Site Settings' | 'checkmail'.



Configuration
-------------

There are several configuration options to set:

- POP3 E-Mail Server
Give your e-mail server. As Example: 'Drupal.org' (Without the '' and without an @)

- POP3 E-Mail Port
Enter the port, which is used to get access to the mail server. As far as I know this 
should always be '110'. (But I am not sure about that.)

- POP3 E-Mail Username
Your username to get access to identify yourself on the mailserver.

- POP3 E-mail Alias
This is the piece of your email address in front of the @Your-Domain.com. 
For Example if your e-mail address is 'Stefan@Drupal.org'. This should be 'Stefan'.

- POP3 E-Mail Password
Without the password, we will never get r mail on the page. So, I think this speaks 
for it selves.



Requirements
------------

Requires Drupal version 4.0 or later



Todo
-----

- Haven't got any idea, but idea's are always welcome.
